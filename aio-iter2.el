;;; aio-iter2.el --- Reimplement aio using iter2 -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Version: 1.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "26.1") (aio "1.0") (iter2 "1.0"))

;;; Commentary:

;; `aio-iter2` provides new versions of the `aio-lambda`, `aio-defun`, and `aio-with-async`
;; macros that are defined using `iter2-lambda` instead of `iter-lambda`, in order to
;; obtain the benefits of `iter2-lambda` in `aio`-using code.

(defmacro aio-iter2-lambda (arglist &rest body)
  "Like `lambda', but define an async function.

ARGLIST and BODY are as in ‘lambda’.  The body of this function may use
`aio-await' to wait on promises.  When an async function is called, it
immediately returns a promise that will resolve to the function's return value,
or any uncaught error signal.

Replacement of `aio-lambda` that uses `iter2-lambda` instead
of `iter-lambda`."

(defmacro aio-iter2-with-async (&rest body)
  "Evaluate BODY asynchronously as if it was inside `aio-iter2-lambda'.

Since BODY is evalued inside an asynchronous lambda, `aio-await'
is available here.  This macro evaluates to a promise for BODY's
eventual result.

Beware: Dynamic bindings that are lexically outside
‘aio-iter2-with-async’ blocks have no effect.  For example,

  (defvar dynamic-var nil)
  (defun my-func ()
    (let ((dynamic-var 123))
      (aio-iter2-with-async dynamic-var)))
  (let ((dynamic-var 456))
    (aio-wait-for (my-func)))
  ⇒ 456

Other global state such as the current buffer behaves likewise."
